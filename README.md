## Slack Incoming Webhook
Incoming Webhooks are a simple way to post messages from apps into Slack. Creating an Incoming Webhook gives you a unique URL to which you send a JSON payload with the message text and some options. You can use all the usual markup and attachments with Incoming Webhooks to make the messages stand out.
